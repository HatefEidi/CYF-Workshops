# Code comprehension

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctrl + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

Consider the code in this program below:

```js
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function logSum(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

const result1 = calculateSum(10, 32);
const result2 = logSum(10, 32);
```

a) what will `result1` evaluate to? Explain your answer
It evaluates to 42 because it calls calculateSum function which takes two parameters, in this case 10 and 32 which are arguments and add them together which evaluates to 42

b) What will `result2` evaluate to? Explain your answer
It logs out nothing because the function does not return anything

c) Try to summarise the main difference between `logSum` and `calculateSum` 
logSum doesn't return anything therefor it gives an undefined while calculateSum returns a value a+b which evaluates to 42
