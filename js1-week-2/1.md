# Predict => Run => Observe => Explain

Remember to **preview a markdown file** on your computer you can do:
Ctr + Shift + V (Windows/Linux) or CMD + Shift + V (Mac)

In this task, you'll need to look at some code in `1.js` and, firstly, predict what it will do, **without executing it**.

My prediction:  currentYear is a variable not a function so when we say currentyear() the system doesn't recognise it and will throw an error.
Afterwards, you can execute the code in `1.js` to check your answer üìù
