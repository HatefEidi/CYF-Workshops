You've started to see **assertions** in your coursework that look something like this:

```js
expect(sum(10,32)).toBe(42);
```

a) Describe, in your own words, what the above assertion checks.
it expect the sum of 32 and 10 to be 42 otherwise the assertion would be false.
Now try the following:
it checks the result of function sum call with passed arguments of 10 and 32 to see if it is 42, if it is the program doesn't run the assertion if it is not, it will show the assertion line

b) Write an **assertion** that checks that a function `isMultipleOfTen` returns `true` when called with the input `80`
You can check out the [Jest documentation here](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#matchers) to help you with this task.

expect(isMultipleOfTen(80)).toBe(true);
