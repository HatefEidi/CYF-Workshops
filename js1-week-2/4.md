Q: What is the difference between a fork and cloned repository?

A: a fork repository has a origin that PR can be done it the owner of the origin repository accept the changes, but clone repository is only on a local device and it they want to push their commits they need to be added as a collaborative to do the PR locally on their VS Code.


Remember to commit and push when you're finished!
