OFNR: Observation, Feelings, Needs, Request
1. Observations:  Tell the other person the behavior you observe from them that is making you uncomfortable.
2. Feelings:  Explain how the person’s behavior makes you feel (happy, sad, angry, annoyed, excited, worried, scared, hurt, embarrassed, confused)
3. Needs: Describe what you need from the other person (physiological, safety, social, esteem, self-actualization)
4. Requests: Ask them specifically what you’d like them to do.
Scebario2: 
Try Applying the ONFR method to the following scenario: A team member gives an informative presentation that is too long-winded, going over an hour causing the audience to lose focus. This presentation will be used at the next client meeting which is only 1 hour long and needs to cover many other topics.
Objective: Use the (OFNR) framework to give the team member feedback. Practice providing feedback on communication skills, structuring information, and presentation techniques.
Hatef: 
Situation: Millena, from what I have noticed form your presentation is that it's a bit too long.
Feeling: When you were presenting after the middle of the presentation, I lost you because I don't thing that the information was necessary or related to the topic
Needs: I want you to work on your teamwork and time management.
Request: I need you to restructure your presentation, make it faster because we are not going to ave enough time for the rest of the team 
Millena:
Observation: Hatef from I have observed from your presentation is that you spend a lof of time on your presentation 
Feelings: I feel like a little bit confused about how you're gonna handle the time limit you have of the presentation
Needs: I need you to follow the time management for the presentation.
Request: Would you like to have some extra time to practice your presentation? 



ASK: Actionable, Specific,
Actionable
The receiver is able to do something with the feedback. Make sure they understand exactly what you want them to do in response. Avoid ambiguity by making it clear what their next steps could (or should) be.
Yes: I would like to know earlier if you realize that a story is going to take longer than expected. 
No: You took too long to finish that story. 

Specific
The receiver understands exactly what events prompted the feedback. Try not to make generalizations, and instead give examples of the behavior or situations. 
Yes: When we were pairing this afternoon, I felt like I was doing most of the driving while we were working on the back end. 
No: You aren’t good at the back end.

Kind
While this may seem obvious, delivering good feedback requires empathy. Even if it’s the most crucial feedback in the world, if it isn’t delivered kindly, they might just ignore it.  
Yes: It’s important to make sure that variable names are clear. Calling this method `meow` doesn’t do a good job of showing intent to the next developer who reads this code. 
No: That’s a stupid method name.

Scenario 3: A colleague dominates team discussions, interrupting others or dismissing alternative ideas without considering them. His behavior is often seen as grating or rude by the team.
Objective: Use the ASK framework to give feedback. Start by addressing the actionable issue and be specific in your request. Make sure it is delivered in a kind and understanding manner. Address how their behavior affects group dynamics and encourage a more inclusive approach, allowing others to share their thoughts.

Hatef: 
Actionable: Millena I would like you to think in earlier group discussion of our, you interuptted many of your work colleagues and didn't let them finish their ideas and talk.
Specific: I would like you to respect and think of the value of other team mates' ideas and opinions
Kind: I like you to be as proactive as you are now, but it would be better if you put your teammates in consideration also. Could you work on this please?

Millena:
Actionable: Hatef I think, when it comes to team meeting whenever you are giving feedback, you dominating the group with your opinions and feedback.
Specific: I want you to work on that to give the other group mates to have their chance to give their opinion and feedback and to discuss.
Kind: I like how you pup up with good ideas on the top but I really want you to give others opportunity to share their ideas


Goal, Reality, Options, Will (GROW) model
The Grow framework focuses on mentoring and guidance to give feedback
Goal: Explore the individual's goals
Reality: Assess the current reality
Options: Brainstorm options
Will: Create a list of actions to commit to to achieve the goal
Scenario: A colleague is working towards a promotion to senior software engineer and has asked you for feedback on their performance. Although they have great technical proficiency you have noticed that they do not speak up during meetings unless directly asked and often wait for tasks to be assigned instead of taking initiative.

Objective: Use the GROW model to speak with your colleague.
